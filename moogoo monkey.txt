Each monkey has 4 slots arranged in a 2*2 configuration.

The player has 5 cards in his inventory, these cards cannot be duplicate of cards in the computer's hands nor cards that are still in the deck.
	


BEGINNING GAMEPLAY:

Once it is the player's turn, the player will be asked to place a coconut on one of the monkey's that do not have all of their slots filled with bets. This will automatically add 1 point to the player's score.

Next, the player will be asked to place a card out of his inventory and place it on a monkey of his choosing. That card will automatically replace whatever card was placed on top of it.

When a card is selected to be placed on the board, it is voided from the inventory of said player.

In the event that a card is overwritten, it will return the dealer.



ENDING EACH ROUND:

Once every monkey has a card under it, whichever monkey has the lowest value card is erased. All of the bets placed on said monkey are voided and subtracted from the players' scores.

In the event that all monkeys' slots contain cards but there is a tie for the lowest value, play will continue until their is a absolute lowest number. If all betting slots are filled up durring this event, the players' turn will consist of only placing cards. 
 


DETERMINING WINNER:	
	
The winner is determined by the amount of icons on all of the monkey's at the end of the entire game. 
Whoever has the most icons wins

In the event that their is a tie between two or more players, instead of ranking first, second, and third, it will say for example ''first and second place: Alice and Mat'' or ''first, second, and third place: Alice, Mat, and Tim''
