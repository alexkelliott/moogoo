# Moogoo Monkey Recreation
This project is a recreation of the Moogoo Monkey minigame from the Sims Urbz.
I do not own any rights to Moogoo Monkey or the Sims Urbz nor am I profiting in any way from this project.
I am simply a fan of the game.

## Installation
There are two ways to install and play. (I) Download the executable and follow the prompts (TODO). (II) Download the source files and run it.

### Executable
This option will be added when I feel it has reached a point where it can be released.

### Run from source
1. Ensure you have [python](https://www.python.org/) installed on your machine
2. Install [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) 
3. Install [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) using command `pip install pygame`
4. Either (I) download this repository as a .zip or (II) with git, clone using `git clone https://github.com/alexkelliott/moogoo.git`
5. Start playing by running `python game.py`
